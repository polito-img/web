Low-delay video communications are required by many applications, ranging from teleconferencing to remote operations. For the specific case of remote operations and manipulation the delay has a paramount importance in determining the quality of experience. For this specific scenario the term ultra-low-delay video communications has been coined.

The Internet Media Group is active in this research field, especially through its participation in the [FAROS](http://www.faros-automation.org) project, aimed at, among other things, to implement an ultra-low-delay digital video feedback channel for remote operations.

A prototype with 3D vision capabilities has been developed and presented by the Internet Media Group at the [Mecatronic Connection 2012](http://www.mecatronic-connection.com/index.php/en) in Torino on Nov 27, 2012.
