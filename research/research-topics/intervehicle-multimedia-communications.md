For instance, the intervehicle communications scenario is very interesting for the potential applications, especially towards safety and warning.

The Internet Media Group performed numerous experiments in this field, investigating the best solutions to transmit voice and video among vehicles and with the infrastructure. The activity involved numerous practical experimentations and it led to a demonstrator showing how to improve safety at intersections by means of warning messages captured by onboard devices. See the [project site](http://media.polito.it/WiSafety) for more information (in Italian).
