[![]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/speech_coding_mini.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/speech_coding_mini.png){: .align-left} The first research activities in the history of the Internet Media Group addressed the processing and transmission of voice signals. Despite nowadays video has gained a significant share of multimedia communications, especially in terms of the bandwidth used for transmission, the core competencies of signal processing and transmission have been the basis on which all the remaining research activities have been build. Moreover, video rarely comes without voice and audio, therefore those competencies are still a key asset in the research activities of the group.

In order to develop and test new techniques, a mix of theoretical analysis, modeling, simulations and practical experimentations are used whenever possible.
