Despite the majority of the employed multimedia codecs are usually lossy, lossless cannot be avoided for particular application domains, such as studio and archiving applications. Moreover, it is important to archive information in a lossless format efficiently since this will enable the possibility to recode information in the future when improved lossy codecs are developed. Comparisons with state-of-the-art and standards (when available) are always performed.
