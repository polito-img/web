One of the main advantages of distribuited video coding (DVC) schemes is to move the computational complexity from the encoder to the decoder. Since DVC schemes makes heavy use of channel coding in their implementation, the scheme is inherently robust to communication problems.

However, packet networks present peculiarities that require some adaptation of current existing DVC schemes, e.g., packet losses instead of bit errors can cause problems in decoding channel codes.

Within the activities of the [S2EuNet](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/247083) project, the Internet Media Group is investigating how to improve some of the existing DVC schemes to achieve better performance in communications over packet networks.
