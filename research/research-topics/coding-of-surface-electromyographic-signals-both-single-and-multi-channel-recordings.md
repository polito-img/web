[![]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/Fig_emg-300x300.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/Fig_emg.png){: .align-left} New compression techniques have been developed for surface Electromyographic signals (EMG).
As with multimedia applications, sensors are becoming increasingly cheaper therefore allowing for multi-channel recordings. Developing efficient techniques to cope with the amount of information generated by those sensors is extremely important to allow the devices to be cheap and portable.

New algorithms are mostly developed through simulations based on signals acquired from the real world.
