[![3D display]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/Sensacio3D_mini.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/Sensacio3D_mini.png){: .align-left} Multimedia communications is a significant share of the overall network traffic.Â  It is expected that enriched form of multimedia communications, such as 3D or multiview, will be increasingly deployed in the future Internet.

The Internet Media Group is active is this research field, investigating how robustness multimedia techniques can be designed for this specific type of communication, that exhibit peculiar characteristics with respect to traditional forms of communications.

A mix of theoretical analysis, modeling, simulations and practical experimentations are used whenever possible.
