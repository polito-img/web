[![Synthetic image compression]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/icip05_micro.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2011/04/icip05_micro.jpg){: .align-left} The Internet Media Group actively works in improving the way audio-visual signals are processed, especially for compression purposes. For instance, techniques aimed at particular video signals such as synthetically-generated ones have been developed and investigated, exploiting the side information available from the 3D model to improve the video quality. The research activities tries to be **standard compliant** as much as possible (e.g., MPEG and H.26x for video), in order to easy the process of porting the proposed techniques towards successful implementation in the industrial world.

A mix of theoretical analysis, modeling, simulations and practical experimentations are used whenever possible.
