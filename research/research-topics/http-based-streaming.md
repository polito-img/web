[![DASH]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2013/03/DASH.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2013/03/DASH.png){: .align-left} HTTP-based audio/video streaming is becoming increasingly common since it can be easily deployed in existing networking infrastructures that only support web access.

The Internet Media Group is active in this research field, especially by closely following the development of the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard. We also host a mirror of the [dataset](http://www-itec.uni-klu.ac.at/dash/?page_id=207) of [ITEC](http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/tewi/inf/itec) - Alpen-Adria Universit√§t in Klagenfurt, Austria, originally developed to perform tests concerning the DASH standard. The mirror is particularly useful to promote further experimentation by providing the possibility to download the streaming data from multiple sources positioned in different physical locations. The whole dataset is available via [https](http://streaming.polito.it/dash/dataset/mmsys13).
