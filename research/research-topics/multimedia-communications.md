Multimedia communications is a significant share of the overall InternetÂ  traffic. However, the current Internet technology is not designed to support the Quality of Service (QoS) required by multimedia applications.

The Internet Media Group aims at investigating how to achieve reliable communications over packet networks. Knowledge from both the application domain and the networking and lower layer is used to design new robustness techniques so that the quality of the communication as perceived by the final user is maximized. The research activities address both networks which do not offer QoS guarantees, such as the current Internet, and networks which provide various degrees of QoS, e.g., DiffServ or pipeline forwarding technologies. Both wired and wireless networks are considered.

A mix of theoretical analysis, modeling, simulations and practical experimentations are used whenever possible.
