The **Internet Media Group** research activity focuses on **multimedia** (speech, audio, video) processing and transmission over communication networks. As interdisciplinary as required by modern technology and services, this group studies and proposes advanced techniques for multimedia applications such as streaming, videoconferencing, voice over IP, that guarantee optimal utilization of network resources and high perceptive quality for the end-user. The main focus is on state-of-the-art multimedia coding formats (voice, audio, video) and data delivery over IP packet networks, as well as media quality assessment for which the group is very active in the [JEG-Hybrid](https://vqegjeg.github.io/jeg-hybrid) working group of [VQEG](https://vqeg.org).
