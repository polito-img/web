("Laurea") degree in Computer Engineering in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering in 2004, both from the [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it), Turin, Italy. In 2003 he was a Visiting Researcher at the [Signal Compression Laboratory](https://scl.ece.ucsb.edu), [University of California, Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu), hosted by [prof. K. Rose](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/kenneth-rose), where he worked on joint source channel coding algorithms for video transmission. He worked as a post-doc researcher until 2010 with the Internet Media Group. Since 2011 he is member of the Control and Computer Engineering Department at the Politecnico di Torino, where he is now Associate Professor. His main research interests include the development of algorithms for quality optimization of communications over packet networks, wireline and wireless, with particular emphasis on multimedia and special attention to particular contexts (e.g., remote control applications) and new technologies (e.g., 3D video, cloud for multimedia). He is co-chair of the [JEG-Hybrid](https://vqegjeg.github.io/jeg-hybrid) working group in the Video Quality Expert Group ([VQEG](https://vqeg.org)), a Senior Member of the IEEE and member of the [PIC4SeR](https://pic4ser.polito.it) (Politecnico di Torino Interdepartmental Center for Service Robotics).

He currently teaches the class "[Internet Video Streaming]({{site.baseurl}}/classes/ivs)" and "[Web Applications](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.guide.visualizza?p_cod_ins=01GYOUV&p_a_acc=2024&p_lang=EN)".

List of publications is available on the [university repository](https://iris.polito.it/browse?type=author&offset=0&authority=rp07554&sort_by=2&order=DESC&rpp=100&submit_browse=Update) or [here]({{site.baseurl}}/publications) (less frequently updated).
