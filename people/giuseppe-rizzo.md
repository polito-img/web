My thesis topic was about clustering and automatic classification of electronic mails, shared with B. Meirone and advised by professors A.R. Meo, F. Di Gregorio and P. Di Nunzio.

**Research activity**

I am currently working on semantic web area, with the specific focuses in P2P network and RAID solution for storing RDF tuples. However, my interests also comprise internet applications, machine learning and artificial intelligence implementations.
