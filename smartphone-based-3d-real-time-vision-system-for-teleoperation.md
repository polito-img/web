We present a small form factor 3D vision system that can easily be mounted in any system for teleoperation and presents a low-latency suitable to perform interactive control. The proposed system is based on a commercial 3D smartphone that integrates a stereoscopic camera and a wireless connection. The smartphone has been customized to acquire and transmit stereoscopic video in real-time by means of a special purpose software that runs on the Android operating system. We believe that the choice of a compact solution based on an open source framework and commercial off-the-shelf hardware, will promote the widespread adoption of this architecture by interested developers in multiple scenarios.
