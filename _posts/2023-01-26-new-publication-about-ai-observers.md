A new [research work]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2023/01/Fotio_SPIC2023_author_version.pdf) titled "[Predicting individual quality ratings of compressed images through deep CNNs-based artificial observers]({{site.baseurl}}/res/2023/01/Fotio_SPIC2023_author_version.pdf)" has been recently published ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2022.116917)) regarding our line of research to create artificial intelligence (AI) observers that can help in better understanding the behavior of observers in subjective quality assessment experiments. Congratulations to all authors for this achievement!
