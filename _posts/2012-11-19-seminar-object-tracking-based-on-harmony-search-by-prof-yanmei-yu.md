Abstract:
The presentation will consist of two parts:

- Introduction to Image Information Institute, Sichuan University and brief overview of research activities
  -  “Object Tracking Based on Harmony Search”. Harmony Search(HS) is a population-based meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, inspired by music. HS has been successfully applied to various optimization problems in the computation and engineering fields. An object tracking based on 4 improved variations of HS will be talked in detail.
