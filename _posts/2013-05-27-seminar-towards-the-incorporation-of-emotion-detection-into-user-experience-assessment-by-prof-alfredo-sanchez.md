Abstract:
Evaluating user experience necessarily involves interpreting emotions expressed or implied by people when presented with a product or a service. Emotions, however, are not always easy to detect and interpret, particularly when methods for detection interfere with the experience under evaluation, or are applied after usage, when emotions cannot be recalled with precision. This talk reports progress towards the development of means for detecting and interpreting emotions as they are experienced, and for their incorporation into the process of evaluating user experience.
