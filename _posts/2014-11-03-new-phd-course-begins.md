The new PhD course "[Multimedia Communications: Technological Advances and Social Implications]({{site.baseurl}}/classes/multimedia-communications)" is scheduled to begin on November 20, 2014. All PhD students can participate (including "XXX ciclo" that started Nov 1, 2014). Three members of our research group (Enrico Masala, Antonio Servetti, Juan Carlos De Martin) will cover all the course topics, as better specified in the [course webpage]({{site.baseurl}}/classes/multimedia-communications).
