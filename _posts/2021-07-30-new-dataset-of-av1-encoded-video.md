Congratulations to our MSc student Federico Serraino who just discussed his [thesis](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/19124) about experimenting different AV1 encoders/decoders, also in a mobile setting. The [resulting dataset](https://github.com/emasala/AV1-performance-analysis) is published on github (original [here](https://github.com/federicoserraino/AV1-performance-analysis)), together with a companion [Android app](https://github.com/federicoserraino/pAV0NE) useful to test AV1 on mobile devices.
