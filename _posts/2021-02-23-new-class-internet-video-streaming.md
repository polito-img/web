A brand new class "_Internet Video Streaming_" (held in Italian) will start March 2, 2021. This substitutes the [old](https://didattica.polito.it/portal/pls/portal/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=02GPJOV&p_a_acc=2020&p_header=S&p_lang=EN) class by focusing less on the details of multimedia standards while better addressing recent advances in the field including HDR and important practical aspects such as how to design cost-effective multimedia systems. More information on the official course description page [here](https://didattica.polito.it/portal/pls/portal/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01URSOV&p_a_acc=2021&p_header=S&p_lang=EN).
