**Course description:**

In the context of the increasing diffusion of multimedia technologies on the web and in social networks, the course presents the latest advancements in the techniques and software architectures for multimedia coding and transmission over the Internet.
Considering the optimality of the presented solutions in order to maximize the communication quality as perceived by the final user, the course shows advanced techniques such as rate-distortion optimization over packet networks and network adaptive strategies.
Moreover, the recent tendency towards HTTP- and browser-based communications which exhibit different optimization challenges will also be addressed, including relevant standards in this context such as DASH.
Finally an overview of the main open source tools and libraries for handling multimedia data will be presented.
