**Internet Video Streaming (IVS)**  
(Valid since 2020)

Teacher: Prof. [Enrico Masala]({{site.baseurl}}/people/masala)

**Course Syllabus**

- Voice and Audio Coding
  - Signals, quantization, SNR, need for signal compression. Lossy compression. Non-uniform quantization. (review only)
  - Voice signals (narrowband and wideband). Voice coding: G.711, log-PCM, DPCM, linear prediction, APCM, ADPCM, G.726.
  - Voice production model. Analysis of voice signal, intelligibility. LPC tecniques. Quality: MOS.
  - Other approaches: MELP, CELP, GSM-AMR.
  - Audio Signals. Audibility threshold. Frequency masking.
  - Perceptual audio coding, psycho-acoustic model. Audio standards: MPEG layer 1,2,3. AAC.
- Images and Video Coding
  - Introduction. Luminance, color spaces. Lossless coding: run-length, GIF, PNG. Lossy coding: JPEG.
  - Video hybrid codec: differential encoding with motion compensation.
  - Video standards: MPEG-x, H.26x, HEVC, VVC, AV1.
  - Stereoscopic / 3D / Multiview video: principles and standards.
- Multimedia communications
  - Multimedia communication scenarions (VoIP, streaming, etc.)
  - Protocols for multimedia communications: RTP, RTCP.
  - Techniques for robust real-time multimedia communications over packet networks.
  - Playout buffer, concealment, interleaving, redundancy, FEC, ARQ, rate adaptation.
  - Pull-based streaming techniques (HTTP-based), DASH standard. Real-time communications: WebRTC.
- Multimedia systems at scale
  - Architectures and needs: transcoding, CDN, sizing, analysis of cloud costs.
  - Peculiar contexts: mobile devices (hardware and software constraints)
  - User-generated content (UGC), live applications, cloud gaming
  - Analysis of use cases: Netflix, YouTube, etc.
