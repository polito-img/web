**Simulation of Robust HEVC Decoding in presence of Data Loss**  
by _Enrico Masala_

This software decodes an HEVC-compliant bitstream applying some loss
patterns as given in an input file. Please note that the software
simulates the data loss (in a pretty realistic way) by operating on the
UNCORRUPTED version of the bitstream. The basic idea is similar to the
previous case that deals with AVC.

We are making this software available to the research community free
of charge. If you use this software in your research, we kindly ask that
you reference our paper listed below (in which such an approach has
been used):
