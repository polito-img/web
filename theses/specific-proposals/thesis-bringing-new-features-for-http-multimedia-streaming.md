Streaming technologies are radiply evolving and new functionalities are tested and introduced every year to efficiently support and deliver multimedia streaming over HTTP in a web context.

Among the most recent advances in HTTP multimedia streaming the Internet Media Group is interested in:

- [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) as a protocol for media ingestion that can substitute the widely used (but old) [RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol) protocol
- [Dynamic insertion of commercials/advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming#Dynamic_ad_insertion) such that every user receives a personalized feed of promotions that better suits his interests

In this context several commercial platforms exists that can provide multimedia streaming functionalities ([Wowza](https://www.wowza.com), ...) or dynamic ad insertion ([Adwiz](https://www.adswizz.com)), while others exists that are open source and free to use but advanced sys-adm skills are often required ([Nginx + RTMP](https://opensource.com/article/19/1/basic-live-video-streaming-server)).

We are looking for master thesis students interested in studying, implementing, and testing new functionalities on top of existing open source solutions for [HTTP multimedia streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming). The activity can be carried out without being physically present on a day-to-day basis at the Politecnico. If interested, please submit your CV and statement of interest to: antonio.servetti@polito.it
