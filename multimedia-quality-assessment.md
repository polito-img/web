Multimedia quality assessment is a key asset to develop efficient multimedia systems. The best results are achieved through subjective experiments which involve the judgement of human subjects, but this is not always feasible.

The Internet Media Group aims at investigating methods to assess multimedia quality and in particular trying to estimate and model the results that would be achieved by a subjective experiment by means of objective methods. A mix of theoretical analysis, modeling, simulations and practical experimentations are used whenever possible.

Many of the activities, which led to [research papers]({{site.baseurl}}/publications) and [software]({{site.baseurl}}/software-and-data/activities-within-jeg), have been conducted in collaboration with the [JEG-Hybrid](https://vqegjeg.github.io/jeg-hybrid) working group of the Video Quality Expert Group ([VQEG](https://vqeg.org)), in which the group members regularly participate.
